// You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method.
// It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i in O(1) time.
// If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.)
// Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs.
// If x occurst multiple times, you may return the index
